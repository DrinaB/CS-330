# How do I approach designing software?
The design process that I followed was to complete my nightstand. I want to make it look as close as possible. Playing with different lighting and textures helped me to make it look great.
I took it one object at a time, and continued to build each one to resemble the photo.
# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach designing progams as a step-by-step. If i did not understand how to complete a task, I would use the resources that are available and be able to come to a solution.
If I am stuck on something, it is a practice of mine to take a 30 minute break and then come back. This allows me to get re-focused instead of frustated. I make sure to devlop to the best of my ability.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science can help me achieve my goals by allowing me to learn new skills that will translate into the workforce. Computer science challenges you, so it 
will help you to become a better problem solver, and learn how to navigate challenges. This class was a challenge for me, but I was able to take away a lot from it.
